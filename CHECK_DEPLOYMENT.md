# ✅ Check Your Deployment

## Your Dashboard URLs

1. **Main Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard-3i1jyi6rt-sllls-projects.vercel.app

2. **Marketing Page:**
   - https://dashboard-3i1jyi6rt-sllls-projects.vercel.app/marketing

3. **Login Page:**
   - https://dashboard-3i1jyi6rt-sllls-projects.vercel.app/login

## Check Deployment Status

Go to: https://vercel.com/sllls-projects/dashboard/deployments

Look for the latest deployment - it should show:
- ✅ **Ready** (green) = Success!
- ⏳ **Building** = Still deploying
- ❌ **Error** = Check logs

## If It's Working

Your dashboard is live! You can:
- Visit the URLs above
- Sign up/login
- Use all features

## If There Are Still Errors

Share the error message from the deployment logs and I'll help fix it!
